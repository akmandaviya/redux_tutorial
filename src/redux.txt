-> Redux is used for state management of any application, this is done with the help of a centralised/ global store.
-> It has 1) Action (what to do)
          2) Reducer (how to do)
          3) Store (has the application state) 

Action:
action are plain js object that have type field
action is created by a action creator , which is a pure function

Reducer:
reducer takes function that takes the current/initial state and an action as argumments and return a new state as a result

Store:
store has state, actions, reducers all together
we will only have a single store in a redux application
every redux store has a single root reducer function

Redux principles:
-> Global state of our application is stored as an object inside a single Store.
-> The only way to change the state is to dispatch an action.
-> Immutability, one way data flow, predictability of outcome.
-> changes are made with pure reducer function
